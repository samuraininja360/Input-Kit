# Input Kit on Scratch
The official repository for the Scratch Project: Input Kit by @samuraininja360

I have to admit this project was one of my best engines ever. It includes a swipe detector, scroll detector, cloud data processor, custom mouse cursor and even more!
This allows you to create stunning projects with incredible UI and functionality. Thanks to the Scratch community for supporting and hopefully this goes on trending!
